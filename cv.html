<h2>Profile</h2>

<p>
    I’m Journalist currently work in Galway Bay fm. I started working in the radio station in August 2019 as part of a graduate programme that was run by Learning Waves. My main role is as a reporter and newsreader but also help manage the newsroom’s social media accounts. I’m currently doing a master’s degree in Digital Media at NUI Galway. Since starting the MA, I’ve learned a huge amount about social media design and the distribution of information. I’m very concerned about the impact that disinformation is having on society. I believe in the promotion of media literacy and as a key tool in the fight against it. It’s an area I’ve become fascinated in and one I’m very keen to branch into.

<h2>Career History</h2>
<h3>Galway Bay FM - 2019 - Present</h3>
<br>

<p>
I was one of five graduates selected for Learning Waves’ first graduate programme in 2019. It was a fantastic experience and a major boost for me in terms of career advancement and personal development. The scheme lasted five months and I was hired on a full-time basis once it finished. I’ve been working as reporter and newsreader ever since. Pre-COVID, I spent much of my time attending and reporting on local authority meetings and various events around Galway. Since the pandemic began, I’ve been faced with new challenges including adapting to remote working, working on my own or in smaller teams and overcoming various obstacles such as conducting socially distant interviews.

<h3>No More Bets, September – March 2018</h3>
<br>

<p>No More Bets is a radio documentary I created for my final year project in DIT. It tackles the issue of gambling addiction in Ireland through an in-depth interview with Tony O’Reilly – the man behind the book Tony10. I recorded the interview, narrated the piece and edited it together using ProTools. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/schoolofmedia/paul-hyland" target="_blank" >Schoolofmedia</a></p>

<h3>Master’s Degree: Current research projects 2020-2021</h3>
<br>
<p>As part of my master’s degree I’m currently working on a number of research projects. I’m leading the development of an app that allows users to search for recipe ideas based on the food items they have in their homes. I came up with the initial idea and I’m working through developing a prototype with two of my classmates. 

I’m also developing a prototype for a game that aims to teach teenagers about the dangers of gambling. The working title I’ve given it is Know the Stakes. It’s a quiz based game that mimics certain aspects of gambling apps, while flagging the reasons why these design features have been selected. My hope is that playing the game, young people will be able to spot potentially harmful ads and gambling apps in future.
